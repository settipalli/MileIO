    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At MileIO we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for
            things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
        </li>
        <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights.
        </li>
        <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our
            services.
        </li>
        <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search
            engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        MileIO.com(henceforth termed, “<strong>MileIO</strong>” for the rest of the document) is operated by
        Santhoshkumar Settipalli. It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect
        while operating our website.
    </p>

    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>

    <p>
        Like most website operators, MileIO collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
        browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
        and the date and time of each visitor request. MileIO’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how MileIO’ visitors use its website. From time to time, MileIO may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on
        trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>

    <p>
        MileIO also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
        for logged in users and for users leaving comments. MileIO only discloses logged in user and commenter
        IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
        described below, except that commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the
        Site where the comment was left.
    </p>

        of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with MileIO may be asked to provide additional information,
        including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each
        case, MileIO collects such information only insofar as is necessary or

        personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always
        refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in
        certain website-related activities.
